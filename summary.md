# BMN Landing Page - Check Icon Connecting Lines Implementation

## Overview
Added visual connecting lines between check icons in the About section to create a cohesive flow and guide users through the feature list.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure Updates
- **File**: `index.html` (lines 72-123)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `relative` positioning to the main features container
  - Added `feature-item` class to each feature item div

### 2. CSS Implementation
- **File**: `index.html` (lines 8-24)
- **Added styles**:
  ```css
  .feature-item:not(:first-child)::before {
      content: '';
      position: absolute;
      left: 16px; /* Center align with the icon */
      width: 2px;
      height: 24px; /* Connect icon centers */
      background-color: #CEFCF4; /* Light green matching icon background */
      top: -28px; /* Position to connect icon centers */
      z-index: 1;
  }
  
  .feature-item {
      position: relative;
      z-index: 2;
  }
  ```

### 3. Visual Design Details
- **Line Color**: `#CEFCF4` (light green, matching the icon background)
- **Line Width**: 2px for clean, subtle appearance
- **Line Height**: 24px to connect the centers of adjacent icons
- **Positioning**: Centered horizontally with the check icons (16px from left)

## Features Connected
The connecting lines now visually link these 5 feature items:
1. Access a diverse pool of quality social creators
2. Get pre-selected agency/brand bookings  
3. Automate and centralize your campaign workflows
4. Cut costs with confirmed wholesale rates
5. Receive support from throughout the process

## Technical Implementation
- Used CSS `::before` pseudo-elements to create lines
- Applied to all items except the first (`:not(:first-child)`)
- Proper z-index layering ensures lines appear behind icons
- Responsive design maintained with existing Tailwind classes

## Testing
- Local server started on port 8000 for visual testing
- Lines properly align with icon centers
- Visual flow creates intuitive reading pattern from top to bottom

## Files Modified
- `index.html` - Added CSS styles and HTML class names
- `summary.md` - This documentation file (new)

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for production. The connecting lines enhance the user experience by creating a visual flow that guides users through the feature benefits in a logical sequence.
