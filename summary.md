## Completed Tasks

- **Fixed scrollbar jump issue when modal opens**: Resolved the problem where the browser scrollbar disappears when the "Get Started" modal opens, causing content to shift:
  - Added CSS to force scrollbar to always be visible (`overflow-y: scroll` on body)
  - Created `modal-open` class that hides body overflow and adds padding to compensate for scrollbar width
  - Updated modal JavaScript to use `modal-open` class instead of directly setting overflow style
  - Added padding to modal container to prevent content shift
  - Ensures smooth user experience without layout jumps when opening/closing modal
